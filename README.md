👋 Hi, I am a junior in Information Security who is interested in Penetration Testing and Research. I desire to learn, practice new techniques about web security in a professional environment.

Apart from my work, I spend time finding the vulnerabilities in web applications through many Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosure Programmes. I have been acknowledged on CERT-EU HoF, United Nations HoF, MediaTek, Bosch and got appreciation from NCSC Netherlands, Latvian CERT.
